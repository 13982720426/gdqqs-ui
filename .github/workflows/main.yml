# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
   # branches: [ "master" ]
    tags:
      - 'v*'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]


  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
